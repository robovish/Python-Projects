Python Framework
1. Main File -  
a. with DB details as args
b. build login credential functionality with a backend in sqlite 
c. Import other modules as per functionality
--Prelim tbl - dmd_temp1, po_temp1, inv_temp1, SKU_final_list, ss1_temp1, prep_temp1
--Supply current and Prod current all logic in one file 
--Unconstrained file 
--Constrained file 

d. parallel option:
--Async -no
--subprocess checked and worked fine 
--airflow dag -no

Solution Models:
1. Simple jupyter python scipt wih all codes in a python file and sql called - Basic Python automation - No Ops support needed 
and enhancement can be handled by Client- Most flexible way
2. Build a basic Python framework which takes User Input as DB crdentials from CMD for main file
2. Prepare an exe file with DB credential hard coded - Would need to provide Ops support in case of any failure or change of code.
3. Prepare an exe file with basic terminal UI and taking in DB connection settings and running it.
4. Prepare an exe file with basic Streamlit UI and taking in DB connection settings and running it.
5. Prepare an exe file with basic terminal UI and taking in DB connection settings and running it and Dockerize it. - Use Airflow
6. Prepare with above Docker image and deploy on Cloud Run with Airflow for schedule

Todays work:
1. Prepare Python framework for Interim tbls
